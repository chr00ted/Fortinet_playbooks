These are my working fortinet playbooks based off ansible galaxy's fortinet.fortios version: 2.3.5 (see collection dir's: requirements.yml)

fortinet_admin_user.yml Adds an Admin user to your Fortinet (I'm using AWX Surveys to prompt the user for input)
fortinet_backup.yml Backs up your Fortinet configs
fortinet_config_snmp.yml configures SNMP on you fortigates
fortinet_gather_fortiaps_info.yml Gathers information about all FortiAP's in your environment
fortinet_upgrade_firmware.yml upgrades your firmware. This works, but I want to add more to it in the future
update_custom_categories1.yml Allows you to add items to your custom categories web filters
